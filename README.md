# hexagonal-wave-function-collapse
Hexagonal adaptation of the wave function collapse algorithm

Uses ES6 classes and typescript, because I dont want to next guys eyes and brain to burn as much as mine did when first reading the code.

Whats the purpose of this? Why hexagons?
Because I can and 4 < 6. So its clearly better.

Special thanks for porting the original algorithm, even though it was in prototypal javascript and I basically had to rewrite the whole thing anyway
